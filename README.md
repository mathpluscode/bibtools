# bibtools

A bibliography toolkit for LaTeX, built as a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin.

- **[bibtidy](#bibtidy)** — Cross-check BibTeX entries against Google Scholar, CrossRef, and conference/journal sites. Upgrades arXiv/bioRxiv preprints to published versions (even when the title changed upon publication), corrects metadata (authors, pages, venues), and flags semantic duplicates (e.g. a preprint and its published version cited separately).

## Install

Add the marketplace in Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add mathpluscode/bibtools
```

Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install bibtools@mathpluscode-bibtools
```

Reload plugins:

```bash
/reload-plugins
```

## bibtidy

```
/bibtidy refs.bib
```

bibtidy verifies each entry against [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) and [CrossRef](https://search.crossref.org/), fixes errors, and upgrades stale preprints to published versions. Every change includes the original entry commented out above so you can compare or revert, plus a `% bibtidy: source` URL for verification. If CrossRef has a match for an entry that bibtidy changes, it also adds `% bibtidy: crossref <URL>` so you can see exactly which CrossRef record was available. We recommend using git to track changes. If using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), this can be done with [git sync](https://docs.overleaf.com/integrations-and-add-ons/git-integration-and-github-synchronization). To remove bibtidy comments after review, ask Claude: "remove all bibtidy comments from refs.bib".

Note that bibtidy assumes standard brace-style BibTeX like `@article{...}`. Parenthesized forms like `@article(...)` are not supported; convert them to brace style first.

## FAQ

**How can I trust the output?**

You shouldn't — and that's by design. The point of bibtidy is to surface potential hallucinations and errors in your bibliography. For every changed entry, bibtidy includes a `% bibtidy: source` URL so you can verify the correction yourself. Entries marked unchanged are very likely correct, but not guaranteed. Always check the provided links before accepting changes.

**Why does bibtidy flag so many page number errors?**

Google Scholar extracts metadata by scraping PDFs rather than querying publisher databases, so page numbers are frequently incorrect. Even official sources can disagree — for example, the same CVPR 2020 paper "Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning" has pages 9729--9738 on [CVF Open Access](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/He_Momentum_Contrast_for_Unsupervised_Visual_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2020_paper.html) but pages 9726--9735 on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9157636), because IEEE re-paginates when compiling the full proceedings volume. bibtidy uses CrossRef as the authoritative source for page numbers. CrossRef gets metadata directly from publishers via DOI registration, so for IEEE/CVF conferences it returns the IEEE Xplore pagination (9726--9735 in the example above). When sources conflict, bibtidy applies the DOI-linked version and flags the entry with `% bibtidy: REVIEW` so you can verify.

**Why a Claude Code plugin instead of a Python package?**

The core challenge is reliable access to bibliographic data:

- **bibtidy** needs to search Google Scholar, CrossRef, and conference/journal sites. Google Scholar has no official API and bans scrapers; Semantic Scholar's public API (1,000 req/s) is shared globally so availability is unpredictable. Claude Code's built-in web search sidesteps both problems — no API keys, no shared rate limits. Citation metadata (title, authors, venue, year) is almost never behind a paywall, so Claude can simply visit the publisher page and read the correct information.

Building on Claude Code also keeps the codebase small — the plugin reuses existing search and editing capabilities rather than reimplementing HTTP clients, parsers, and retry logic.

**Do I need Claude Code?**

Yes. bibtidy is currently a Claude Code plugin only. If there's demand to support other platforms (e.g. Codex), we'll consider adding it.
